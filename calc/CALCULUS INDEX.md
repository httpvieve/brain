# DIFFERENTIATION $$\boxed{f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[x^{n}] = n \cdot x^{n-1}} $$
-> gives the function that will tell you the ==slope== of the tangent of the line at some x value
-> useful for calculating the ==instantaneous rate of change==
-> tells you ==how fast== something changes per unit of time

$$ \frac{d}{dx} = \frac{\Delta x}{ \Delta y} =\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}} $$

# [[INTEGRATION]] $$\boxed{\int x^{n}dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n + 1} + c}$$
-> opposite process of differentiation / ==anti-derivative== 
-> useful for calculating the ==area== under the curve 
-> helps you determine ==how much== something accumulates over a period of time
$$A = x \cdot y$$
