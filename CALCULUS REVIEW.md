# LIMITS



# DERIVATIVES $$\boxed{f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[x^{n}] = n \cdot x^{n-1}} $$
-> gives the function that will tell you the ==slope== of the tangent of the line at some x value
-> useful for calculating the ==instantaneous rate of change==
-> tells you ==how fast== something changes per unit of time



# INTEGRATION $$\boxed{\int x^{n}dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n + 1} + c}$$
-> opposite process of differentiation / ==anti-derivative== 
-> useful for calculating the ==area== under the curve 
-> helps you determine ==how much== something accumulates over a period of time
